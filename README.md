# e6bg
This script sets your desktop background to a random image from e621. The artist's name is overlayed in top left corner of the image.

The script uses `feh` to set your background as well as some linux specific fonts but shouldn't be hard to port to other systems.

Dont forget to set your e621 username and api key!

# setup

```
pip install e621py-wrapper
```
